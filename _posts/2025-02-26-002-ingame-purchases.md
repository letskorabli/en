## Introduction

As is known, for some reason we can't purchase in-game items in Mir Korabley directly via credit card. Yet there's still an approach.

## Steps

1. Make sure to choose the region **Беларусь** (Belarus) when you create your Lesta account.

2. On the [Premium Shop](https://lestagames.by/shop/wows/), select the item you want to purchase.

3. Choose the third method of payment, named **ЕРИП** (ERIP).

4. Copy down the order code on the page, which is 8 digits;

5. Visit [Paritet Bank](https://erip.paritetbank.by/).

6. Select the following options in order: **Интернет-магазины/сервисы** → **Игры, социальные сети** → **А-Я Кириллические домены** → **М** → **Мир Кораблей** → **Оплата покупки с lestagames.by**.

7. Paste the order code you just copied into the input box on the page, and click the blue button **Далее**.

8. The page to pay with your bank card will now pop up. Note that there will be a tax of at least **5%** (5% of which will be collected by ЕРИП and the rest depending on the specific bank).
