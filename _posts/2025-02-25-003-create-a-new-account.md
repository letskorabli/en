## Recruiting Station (Sea Brotherhood)

Tips:

1. The best person to be your recruiter is always **a friend you can play with regularly in division**, see Tips 5-8.

2. You can join a recruiting station as soon as your registration is complete.

3. You can join one's recruiting station by visiting his / her own invitation link and clicking the red button **ПРИНЯТЬ ПРИГЛАШЕНИЕ**.

4. When A joins the recruiting station through B's link, B becomes A's Recruiter (Mentor) and A becomes B's Shipmate (Companion).

5. A shipmate can get various items, including **German Tier II Cruiser EMDEN** (after participating the first battle), **English Tier VI Battleship REPULSE** (after participating a battle on a Tier VI ship), **Days of Ship Premium Account**, **Credits**, etc. 

6. **IMPORTANT:** A recruiter can **get a 10% cashback** from his / her shipmates (only when he / she has 2 or more shipmates).

7. Participating Random Battles together will earn both the recruiter and the shipmate an amount of **Community Tokens**.

8. A recruiter can obtain Recruiting Station Pack in exchange for Community Tokens, which **provides both the recruiter and the designated shipmate a recruiting station container**.

## Other Tips
